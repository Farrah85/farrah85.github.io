            <h2>HOUSING </h2>
            <P>First thing on your mind is housing.
            If rent is 1200 for a small studio how can I even expect to save.
            Well to find affordable housing in NYC research is neede.
            You must sign up on the cities lottery apartment website https://Nyc.gov/housingconnect.
            There are times when affordable lotteries are not listed on the site, you should browse the Metro and AM newspapers
            They are free and can be found at you local train station, they provide information on applications for other affordable lotteries. 
            It may take time but once your name is call and you qualify you are on your way to cheaper rent and years of living comfortable even with a pay raise.

            thinking of going healthy and organic Trader Joe's is an option to the more expensive Whole Foods. Target is know for its affordability as well for vitamins and Fruit stands are a good idea as well for fresh or affordable fruits and vegetables. Family dollar, dollar deals and the 99 cent store are a good idea for cleaning and laundry supplies.
